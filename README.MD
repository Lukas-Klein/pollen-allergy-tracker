# Pollen Allergy Tracker

Pollen Allergy Tracker is a personal web application designed to help individuals manage and monitor their pollen allergies. It gathers information on actual and forecasted active pollen levels and their severity from the DWD API (Deutscher Wetterdienst). Users can also input and document the severity of their allergy symptoms, which is then stored on a Supabase backend. This valuable data can be provided to medical professionals to develop targeted immunotherapy treatment plans.

I created this project because I had to manually write my allergy symptoms in a physical calendar, and that process was too much effort for me ðŸ˜„.
